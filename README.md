#**Dice**
A die simulator. Simulates up to 5 dice picking random numbers between 1 and 6.

*This is as random as I could make it. I used two different time stamps triggered at the beggining of the loop and after the user chooses the number of dice. The time stamps are then put through algorithms in the dice functions to shuffle the numbers and hopefully give the appearance of being random*
